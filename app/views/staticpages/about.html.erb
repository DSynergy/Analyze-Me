    <h4>Hey baby, what's your type?</h4>
    <h1>Analyze Me</h1>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <h4>THIS APP WAS WRITTEN IN 2015 AND TWITTER NO LONGER ALLOWS API ACCESS TO TWEETS!</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>Signing in with Twitter, will allow the application to access your recent 100 tweets. Keep in mind, this is only as accurate as your posts are a reflection of the real you.</p>
    <p>Once the application has access to your tweets, it is time to to kick your feet up on that leather couch and click Analyze-Me.</p>
    <p>
      <i>Now the gauntlet happens.</i>
      Your tweets are thrown through the ringer, as they are processed by 7 different api analyzers:
      <strong>Your tweets are analyzed by writing style and word choice to return your Myers-Briggs personality type, as well as your general mood, general age-range or maturity of your language and the breakdown of topics.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>I can't attest for 100 percent veracity of your results, but hey
      <b>at least it is cheaper than therapy, am I right?</b>
    </p>
    <h4>But Dustin...why?</h4>
    <p>The inspiration for this app comes from the interest I have in the differences and similarities between people with different types of personalities.</p>
    <p>Understanding someone's personality allows for better and more substantial interactions. Why stop there though? Let's take it to the next level.</p>
    <p>This app is for anyone interested in personality types and how they are related to how we express ourselves; hopefully, this app will provide some insight into how you portray yourself online as well as how the 16 different types differ in this
      regard.</p>
    <h4>Integrations</h4>
    <p>This app uses the Twitter OAuth provider to analyze your tweets. Hopefully, in the future I will extend this to other media sources such as Facebook.</p>
    <h4>APIs</h4>

    <p>The app uses a gauntlet of 7 APIs to classify content. Mostly based off the work of Mattias Ã–stmar.</p>

    <p>Note: Currently, you can also sign in with Facebook, but I am waiting on permission from the Facebook dev team to get access to a user's posts (even if you sign-in and say it is okay). Analzying facebook posts will be the next phase.</p>
